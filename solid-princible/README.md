# SOLID Principles in PHP

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Design using PHP. Each principle is explained with both bad and good practice examples to illustrate its importance and application.

## What are SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are:

1.  **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2.  **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
3.  **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4.  **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5.  **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Principles Covered:

Here's a list of the SOLID principles demonstrated in this repository:

*   ### [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](./Single-Resposiblity/Readme.md)
    *   A class should have only one reason to change.

*   ### [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](./Open-Close/README.md)
    *   Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

*   ### [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](./Liskov-Subsitution/README.md)
    *   Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

*   ### [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](./Interface-Segregation/README.md)
    *   Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

*   ### [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./Dependency-Inversion/README.md)
    *   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    *   Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
